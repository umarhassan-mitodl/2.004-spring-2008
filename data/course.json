  "course_description": "Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:\n\n*   Create lumped parameter models (expressed as ODEs) of simple dynamic systems in the electrical and mechanical energy domains\n*   Make quantitative estimates of model parameters from experimental measurements\n*   Obtain the time-domain response of linear systems to initial conditions and/or common forcing functions (specifically; impulse, step and ramp input) by both analytical and computational methods\n*   Obtain the frequency-domain response of linear systems to sinusoidal inputs\n*   Compensate the transient response of dynamic systems using feedback techniques\n*   Design, implement and test an active control system to achieve a desired performance measure\n\nMastery of these topics will be assessed via homework, quizzes/exams, and lab assignments.\n",
