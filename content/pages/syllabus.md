**Note:** Unexcused failure to attend the lab sessions will result in a negative score being assigned.

Makeups, etc.
-------------

No exceptions without notification and prior approval of instructors.

Grading Policy
--------------

Grades in this course will be assigned according to each student's demonstrated knowledge of the course material. The Department of Mechanical Engineering has adopted the following guidelines for undergraduate courses:

*   approximately 25% A's
*   approximately 40% B's
*   approximately 25% C's
*   not more than 10% D's and F's.

Course Ethics
-------------

Collaboration is prohibited in the quizzes and the final examination. Collaboration in the form of group discussion of the problem sets is encouraged, but each student is required to submit an original solution.

The use of published solution material from previous years is forbidden.

Penalties for academic misconduct may be internal (that is reduction in grade or receiving an **F**), and/or referral to the Institute's Committee on Discipline (COD).
